1. Initial support for EJB3.0 for JBoss 4 preview release 2.
2. Support for Hibernate 2.
3. Support for Many-to-One, One-to-Many in Web GUI for Hibernate 2 and EJB 3.0.

JAG 3.4.1
=========
1. Support for relations with different column names.
2. The generated JUnit tests are now run agains the service locator, and not against the session EJBs.
3. The initSearchActions in the weblayer decorate the list results with Data objects
   to add presentation specific methods.
4. commons logging configured for the jag gui.
5. support for mysql 4.1 using updated jdbc driver.

JAG 3.4
=======
1. Added templates for the Entity and Session template in Bea Workshop  EJBGen format.
   EJB layer can be generated for Bea Workshop.
2. Added templates for a simple maven project
3. Major architecture change: decoupled web layer from EJB layer with interfaces.
   Introduced a service layer. Use a service locator with
   dynamic business delegates for Session EJBs.
4. Added EJBQL finder methods on the Entity EJBs so for every field a findByFieldName
   is generated. These methods are exposed in the session facade as well.
5. Support for JBoss 3.2.0-1 and JBoss 3.2.2-7 where handling of commons-logging was
   changed.
6. Foreign keys can be primary keys now.
7. Refactored template directory and changed .jag into vsl extension.
8. Added path for service sources and for conf files. Removed webXml and ejbXml paths
9. Generated web application uses the displaytag tag library which greatly improve
   the generated tables with paging, sorting and export functionality.
10.Updated sample application for mysql that can be deployed to JBoss4 without creating
   a database schema. The default test database is used. Also sql script for mysql
   and postgres are provided.

=======
1.  Improved support for i18n.
2.  Added support for JBoss 4
3.  Added support for Sun One Application Server 7
4.  Added support for Bea WebLogic 8.1

JAG 3.2
=======
1.  The finalist-ant task no longer needs internet access in case all jars are
    already local.
2.  When generating the sources, also the required jar files are copied to
    target lib directory.
3.  When connecting to a database also views and synonyms can be selected.
4.  JAG dependent modules have been placed on sourceforge.
5.  Developers section added to the website that links to Maven generated
    documenation.
6.  Check on proxy setting will no longer fail the build so it's not required
    to create the .ant-global.properties file in the parent directory.
7.  Improved support for shared jars by using the ejb-jar Manifest Classpath
    instead of the java-modules. This is more portable across application
    servers.
8.  Home interfaces no longer have the JNDI constants. They have been moved
    to the util classes.
9.  All session EJBs will only expose the remote interfaces and the entity
    EJBs only local interfaces.
10. JNDI names are now generated with seperating / between the package names.
    The ejb name is no longer used with package names. This was introduced
    for previous HP Bluestone Application server support, but this has been
    discontinued.
11. Bugfix: In case the fastlane reader was used, reading a record wasn't done
    with a Entity EJB, but saving was. This may introduce caching problems.
12. Bugfix: the "required" option for Entity EJB field (not nullable fields)
    wasn't set correctly when reading from application file,
    the GUI wouldn't set it.
13. Bugfix: use container managed relations checkbox in config screen was never
    used and always set to true.
14. Bugfix: never allow generation of code with relations in the model and CMR
    CMR unchecked.    

JAG 3.1
=======
1.  It's now possible to configure the target Application Server in the JAG
    GUI configuration panel.
2.  JBoss3.0 and JBoss3.2 are currently supported.

JAG 3.0.1
=======
1.  Up until now, JAG could only connect to databases that were explicitly
    supported (programatically). With the new 3.0.1 release of JAG,
    you can use the "Driver Manager" function to dynamically import new JDBC
    drivers. This enables you (in theory) to connect to any database that
    you have a JDBC driver for. So far succesfully tested against MySQL,
    Oracle 8, HSQLDB (Hypersonic) and PostgreSQL...

JAG 3.0
=======
1.  The 3.0 release sees a major step in JAG's capabilities: the ability to
    import and export system designs to/from third-party UML modelling tools.
    Model your system in UML using tools such as the free-to-download
    Community Edition of PoseidonUML, import the model into JAG and generate
    the J2EE application.

JAG 2.4
=======
1.  Previous versions of JAG were for the most part tested against Oracle
    databases, since the vast majority of Finalist's commercial clients use
    Oracle databases.  While previous versions of JAG also supported MySQL
    (and PostgreSQL) databases, the support was somewhat buggy.
    With version 2.4 we have focused development squarely on bringing the
    support for MySQL databases in to line with the Oracle support.

JAG 2.3
=======
1.  Bug fix releas

JAG 2.2
=======
1.  In this version we have completely revamped the application generation
    templates; replacing the old, slow, hard-to-maintain templates with
    Velocity templates.

JAG 2.1
=======
1.  Version 2.1 is the first release for public download.  This version is
    the first stable public release of JAG, previous versions having been
    used internally within Finalist IT Group.
