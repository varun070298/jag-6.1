========================================================================================================================

JAG 6.0
=======

in a IDE to create a web application.
The current template tree has been refactored to use java5 annotations, generics.
Added search capabilities to the struts templates so specific fields can be searched.
Wildcard search is also supported by using a % in the query.
Upgraded libraries: spring 1.2.5 and postgresql jdbc driver.
Generate a Intellij 5 project file for a web application.
Support for the XFire SOAP framework (based on STAX) (http://xfire.codehaus.org).
Added support for Acegi security login.
Added JSTL taglibs.
Rome RSS feed support.
Many2Many relations support using an association entity.

Tapestry 4 support.

JAG 5.0
=========

Spring and Java 5 support
-------------------------
Spring framework support as service layer for struts/hibernate
Use long hibernate sessions
The default for hibernate now is to allow lazy loading instead of eager loading.
Java5 support can be enabled to:
    - generate @Transaction annotations for spring hibernate 3.
    - Hibernate 3 with Annotations support including composite keys.

Jmeter tests and JUnit testing of spring services
-------------------------------------------------
Add jmeter-ant target to the build.xml and generate a basic test script.
JUnit testing for Spring Framework using the AbstractTransactionalDataSourceSpringContextTests.
Code coverage will be done when junit tests are run using the emma library.

JAG 4.2
=========

Hibernate 3 with xdoclet support
--------------------------------
JAG 4.2 adds support for Hibernate 3 using Xdoclet tags. Since xdoclet currently doesn't have support for Hibernate 3,
Ant postprocessing is used to fix the generated mapping files.

Business methods
----------------
Another big enhancement to JAG is support for Business methods.
You can model business methods in the JAG gui by adding methods to the Sessions or add them in the UML model.
The business methods will appear as service interfaces and stub implementations will be
generated for the selecte business tier.

Axis Webservices
----------------
If webservices are enabled in the JAG gui, the business methods will be exposed using Apache Axis.
To install the webservices, run "ant axis.wsdl2java" which will first generate a WSDL from the business methods,
and convert them to java stubs. After deployment, the webservice can be installed using the
"ant axis.admin" target. The webservice can be tested using "ant test".
To ensure platform indepence of the deployed webservice, also a dotnet test client can be used.
Use "ant dotnet" to build and run a dotnet client for the deployed axis webservice.

JAG 4.1
=========

EJB 3.0
-------
JAG 4.1 supports the EJB3.0 Preview Release 4 for JBoss4. The EJB 3.0 Preview 4 has been tested with JBoss 4.0.1 SP1
To install the EJB3 preview release, please follow the instructions as provied by JBoss.
Start jboss up with the all configuration: "run.sh -c all" or "run.bat -c all".
Make sure java 1.5 is used when starting Jboss (check "java -version"; it should be at least: java version "1.5.0").
To build a generated project with JAG, make sure the jboss4.home property has been set in the .ant-global.properties.
For example: jboss4.home=C:\\apps\\jboss\\jboss-4.1
Due to a classloading issue in the preview release, you will get the following error message at runtime:
"You appear to have an INCOMPATIBLE VERSION of the Commons Lang library ........"
To fix this, you will also have to copy the commons-lang-2.0.jar (which is distributed with JAG),
to the jboss-4.1/server/all/deploy/ejb3.deployer directory and remove the commons-lang-1.0.jar from this directory.

Hibernate 2.1
-------------
JAG 4.1 now supports Hibernate in the Tomcat 5 application server.
Autogenerated primary keys are generated using the increment method.
The mapping files and configuration files are both updated automatically.

JAG 4.0
=========

EJB 3.0
-------
JAG 4.0 supports the EJB3.0 Preview Release 2 for JBoss4. The EJB 3.0 Preview 2 only works with JBoss 4.0.1 RC1.
To install the EJB3 preview release, please follow these instructions:
Copy ejb3.deployer and ejb3-interceptors-aop.xml from the lib/ directory of the EJB3 distribution to
jboss-4.0.1/server/all/deploy
Start jboss up with the all configuration: "run.sh -c all" or "run.bat -c all".
Make sure java 1.5 is used when starting Jboss (check "java -version"; it should be at least: java version "1.5.0").
To build a generated project with JAG, make sure the jboss4.home property has been set in the .ant-global.properties.
For example: jboss4.home=C:\\apps\\jboss\\jboss-4.0.1RC1
Due to a classloading issue in the preview release, you will get the following error message at runtime:
"You appear to have an INCOMPATIBLE VERSION of the Commons Lang library ........"
To fix this, you will also have to copy the commons-lang-2.0.jar (which is distributed with JAG),

Xdoclet is used to generate the mapping files.

The c3p0 connection pool is being used.
