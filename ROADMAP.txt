=============
- Swing client.
- Make EJB 3 support compatible with new drafts when JBoss 4.0.3 is final.
    - @Inject is replaced by @PersistenceContext
    - Package Entities in a .par file.
    - Use a META-INF/persistence.xml in the par file instead of a hibernate.properties file.
- Make the path names and mappings configurable from the template.xml file.
- Implement the webinterface using valuelist handler instead of the displaytag, since it can be plugged into spring.
- Add a validation option to the JAG GUI before the generation starts.
- JUnit 4 with annotations support
- Update the maven build
- Improve Struts GUI: Linking from lists should be based on using a tr (not supported by displaytag); improved navigation.
- Generate a JSF web tier!
- document the Architecture of JAG with Velocity
- autogenerated is selected for primary foreign key. Must be avoided in GUI when selecting tables.
- changing ref names in Entities will break the build if the refs aren't changed in the sessions.
- disabling a primary key doesn't result in disabling the 'auto-generated primary key'.
- Allowing to move entities, fields, sessions and business methods around in the GUI.
- Bug fix for Non-windows platforms on JDK 1.5. The GUI is broken for JDK 1.5 on non-Windows platforms.
