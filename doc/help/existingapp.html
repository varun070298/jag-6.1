<h3>Working with existing applications</h3>
JAG also offers a round-trip functionality, albeit currently limited in extent.
<br>
The process of creating applications with JAG is centred around an <i>application file</i>: an XML file
containing information about the application.  When creating an application you will be prompted at some point to save the
application file.  At a later stage it is possible to open an existing JAG application file to make further changes,
and regenerate the application code.
<p>
You can open an existing application file by choosing the menu File > Open, or by choosing an existing file from
the dialogue opened by clicking the <img align="middle" src="../../images/open.png">&nbsp;button on the toolbar.
<p>
The application will be loaded back into JAG, and then further changes can be made - adding or deleting entities, editing entity  fields and relations,
and adding or removing entities from services.
<p>
If you choose to re-generate the application 'on top of' an existing JAG application, JAG will deal with this in an intelligent manner.
Before writing a file into the project, it will sense if a previous version already exists and if so, prompt you for a suitable action.
<br>
<table width="100%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="images/overwrite.jpg"></td></tr></table>
<p>
From the available options, you can choose to overwrite the existing file or keep the old version.  But in order to make that decision, it
often helps to see what the changes are.  You can do this by selecting the default 'View diff' option, an example of which you can see below.
<br><table width="100%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="images/diff.jpg"></td></tr></table><br>
In the example here, a field name within an entity bean was changed from '<code>naam</code>' to '<code>userName</code>': the file being 'diffed' is the
resultant entity Java class.  For the sake of clarity, lines from the newly generated file are shown in blue, and corresponding lines
from the old file in red.
