<h3>What is JAG?<br>
<img src="images/help.jpg"></h3>
JAG is an application that creates complete, working J2EE applications. It is intended to alleviate much of the repetitive work
involved in creating such applications, while providing a means of quality assurance that the applications created will be
of consistent quality.
<p>

One of the strengths of JAG is that it delivers a complete working project - it's more than just another code generator!  The projects
generated by JAG (using the latest <a href="step_appconfig.html#application_templates"><i>application generation template</i></a>) have
the following features:

<ul>
<li>A full, professional quality project infrastructure:  The generated applications build with <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>
and have a flexible, well-organised directory structure.</li>
<li>By choosing from JAG's extendable framework of 'application templates', you have control to select the most appropriate application architecture.</li>
<li>Best-of-breed J2EE architecture: The various application architectures are derived from a real-world appreciation of industry best practices.
The latest application template offers:
    <ul>
    <li>A strict enforcement of presentation-layer to enable the greatest flexibility in deployment scenarios</li>
    <li>EJB and Hibernate features such as relations.</li>
    <li>J2EE 'BluePrint' patterns such as Session Fa&ccedil;ade, Service Locator, Business Delegate, Fast Lane Reader and Value Objects.</li>
    <li>A pluggable service tier: ServiceLocator or Spring Framework.</li>
    <li>A pluggable business/persistence tier: EJB2/3 or Hibernate 2/3</li>
    <li>Webservices using XFire or Axis</li>
    </ul></li>

<li>Acegi security for declarative authentication and authorization</li>
<li>Tapestry 4 presentation-layer for a component based web tier using java 5 annotations</li>
<li>A presentation layer (web application) that takes advantage of the latest features of <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/!!!EXTERNAL!!!">Struts</a>,
such as declarative client- and server-side user input validations, and clean, modular JSPs using Struts and the <a href="http://displaytag.sourceforge.net/!!!EXTERNAL!!!">display tag library</a>.</li>
<li>Extensive use of Java 5 Annotations or <a href="http://xdoclet.sourceforge.net/!!!EXTERNAL!!!">XDoclet</a> in the generated application means that the complexity of the
code base is vastly reduced, increasing maintainability.  Through the use of XDoclet tags in the generated Java code, many of the JAG-generated classes
serve as a basis for further automatic code generation at build-time!</li>
</ul>

Applications generated by JAG are intended as a solid first step in a project's development phase.  Using the generated application as a base, further
development can be undertaken such as coding business logic into the servicess, customising the web application, etc.
