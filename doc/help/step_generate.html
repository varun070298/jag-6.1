<h3>Generating the application</h3>
Once you have finished adding/editing/deleting the entities in your application, you can then proceed to application generation.
Application generation is started by choosing the menu File > Generate Application, or using the
<img align="middle" src="../../images/execute.png">&nbsp; button on the toolbar.
<p>
Generating an application with JAG is a one step process, however before generation can take place JAG will validate the application
file that you have made.
<p>
Here is an overview of the various validations that are performed:
<ul>
<li>Required fields must be filled in: e.g. the application name, the root package and the datasource URL. </li>
<li>Dead entity references removed: e.g. if an entity was added to a service and subsequently deleted from the application.</li>
<li>Entity bean primary key integrity checks.</li>
<li>Duplicate field/relation names.</li>
<li>Relations - Service integrity checks: if an entity containing relations is added to a service, then the related entity(-ies)
must also appear in a service.  (This is because the FastLaneReader J2EE pattern used by the generated application requires value objects
that can reference their related entity fields through a service fa&ccedil;ade).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once the validations have succeeded, you will be prompted to choose an output directory where the application files will be generated.
The application will be created within the selected directory, in a directory with the same name as the application.
