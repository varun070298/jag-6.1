<h3>Import the UML model into JAG</h3>
<img src="images/import.jpg"><br>
In order for JAG to be able to work with your UML design, you will first have to <i>import</i> it.
<p>
The import function can be found under the <code>File</code> menu, or it also accessible from the keyboard using
the shortcut <code>CTRL-I</code>.  You will be presented with a file chooser dialogue, from which you should select the XMI file that you
saved from the UML modelling tool.
<p>
JAG will read in the data from the UML model and, if you have followed the correct usage of stereotypes outlined
in the previous step, you should then see the entities and services from the model appear in the left-hand side
of the JAG application.

<h3>Exporting a UML model from JAG</h3>
You will also find in the <code>File</code> menu that there is an <code>'Export UML model..'</code> function.
This enables you at any stage to export the application back to your UML modelling tool by saving an XMI file.
