<h3>Creating services</h3>
For the purposes of JAG, services can be considered to 'contain' one or more entities. Services generated by JAG follow the
'service fa&ccedil;ade' pattern: i.e. the entities are responsible for transporting data to and from the persistence layer (database),
while the services provide the presentation layer with an interface to the entities.
<p>
In short, if you wish to expose functionality in your application that relates to data represented by a particular entity,
you will have to make sure that entity is wrapped by a service bean.
<p>
To create a service bean in your application, first select Edit > Add > service from the menu or click the
<img align="middle" src="../../images/session.gif">&nbsp;service button on the toolbar.

<h4>Configuring a service</h4>
<img src="images/session_confscreen.jpg"><br>
The service that you initially create is blank - it has no name, and contains no entity.  The service must
therefore be configured through the configuration screen, shown above.  Here is a description of the various input fields:
<ul>
<li><b>Name:</b> the name used as a prefix to the Java classes generated for this service.</li>
<li><b>Description:</b> an optional natural-language description for this service, used for identification purposes.</li>
<li><b>Root package:</b> the package for the generated service classes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Adding/Removing entities in a service</h4>
<table><tr><td>
The service's configuration screen shows a list of 'Refs': entity references contained by that service.
Clicking the 'Add' button will open up a select list dialogue, which allows you to select one or more entities from your application.<br>
The added entities will appear in the 'Refs' list, and may be deleted by selecting them and clicking the 'Remove' button.
